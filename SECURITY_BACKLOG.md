# AGI Workforce - Security Backlog

**Status**: ⚠️ Historical backlog — re-assess before any beta claims  
**Updated**: 2025-11-26  
**Goal**: Transform from "not safe for public beta" to "powerful but controlled"  
**Philosophy**: Powerful by default, dangerous only with explicit consent

---

## Critical Issues (BLOCKING FOR BETA)

### ✅ = Fixed | 🔄 = In Progress | ⬜ = Pending

- [x] ✅ **Auto-updater signature verification not implemented**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/security/updater.rs:107-127`
  - **Issue**: `verify_signature()` returns `Ok(true)` stub - allows unauthenticated RCE
  - **Fix**: ✅ Disabled updater completely - removed from Cargo.toml and tauri.conf.json
  - **Status**: FIXED - No RCE vector exists

- [x] ✅ **Content Security Policy overly permissive**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:34`
  - **Issue**: `connect-src 'self' ws: wss: http: https:` allows ANY URL
  - **Fix**: ✅ Whitelisted 15 specific domains (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Slack, etc.)
  - **Status**: FIXED - Data exfiltration limited to whitelisted APIs

- [x] ✅ **Placeholder public key in updater config**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:67`
  - **Issue**: `"pubkey": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"`
  - **Fix**: ✅ Removed entire updater configuration
  - **Status**: FIXED - No incomplete security setup

---

## High Issues (FIX BEFORE WIDE BETA)

- [ ] ⬜ **Git commands vulnerable to path injection** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
  - **Files**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/git.rs:52-150`
  - **Issue**: User paths passed directly to `Command::new("git").current_dir(&path)`
  - **Fix**: Use git2-rs library OR sanitize with shlex + path validation
  - **Mitigation**: Policy engine now validates all paths before operations
  - **Impact**: Command injection, arbitrary command execution
  - **Recommendation**: Migrate to git2 before public beta (2-3 days work)

- [x] ✅ **Hardcoded dev path in production script**
  - **File**: `reset-app.ps1:36`
  - **Issue**: `cd C:\Users\SIDDHARTHA NAGULA\agiworkforce`
  - **Fix**: ✅ Moved to dev-scripts/reset-app.ps1 with generic paths and user confirmation
  - **Status**: FIXED - No dev-specific code in production

- [x] ✅ **File path blacklist incomplete and Windows-specific**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/file_ops.rs:103-125`
  - **Issue**: Blacklist misses many sensitive paths, can be bypassed
  - **Fix**: ✅ Implemented workspace-based whitelist with comprehensive scope checking
  - **Status**: FIXED - See `security/policy/scope.rs` for new system

- [x] ✅ **Shell spawning without input validation**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/terminal/pty.rs:37-48`
  - **Issue**: PTY spawns shells without validating cwd parameter
  - **Fix**: ✅ Policy engine now validates cwd for all shell operations
  - **Status**: FIXED - Integrated with central policy engine

- [ ] 🔄 **91 unsafe blocks without security audit** (IN PROGRESS)
  - **Files**: `automation/uia/*.rs`, `automation/input/*.rs`, `automation/screen/capture.rs`
  - **Issue**: Extensive unsafe code (Windows API) without documented safety invariants
  - **Fix**: Document all unsafe blocks, add invariant checks, wrap in safe APIs
  - **Impact**: Memory safety violations, undefined behavior
  - **Recommendation**: Can ship closed beta with warning, full audit before public beta

---

## Medium/Low Issues (NICE TO HAVE)

- [x] ✅ **Guardrails module is empty**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/security/guardrails.rs`
  - **Issue**: Module exists but contains no code
  - **Fix**: ✅ Replaced with comprehensive policy engine at `security/policy/`
  - **Status**: FIXED - Full policy system implemented (see below)

- [x] ✅ **SMTP credentials from environment variables**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/billing/mod.rs:559-565`
  - **Status**: ✅ Documented in SECURITY.md - acceptable pattern

- [x] ✅ **Path traversal check is basic**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/file_ops.rs:86-92`
  - **Issue**: Only checks literal `..`, not URL-encoded variants
  - **Fix**: ✅ Full canonicalization in `security/policy/scope.rs`
  - **Status**: FIXED - Handles symlinks, normalization, URL encoding

- [ ] ⬜ **Certificate thumbprint null**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:48`
  - **Issue**: No code signing configured
  - **Fix**: Document process to obtain and configure cert
  - **Status**: Acceptable for beta - obtain EV cert before wide release

- [ ] ⬜ **No cleanup of temp sandboxes**
  - **File**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/agi/sandbox.rs:22`
  - **Issue**: Temp directories could accumulate
  - **Fix**: Add cleanup hook on app shutdown
  - **Status**: Low priority - can ship beta with manual cleanup instructions

## Guardrail/Policy System (NEW)

### Design Goals
- **Central policy engine** for all sensitive operations
- **Risk-based decisions**: Allow / RequireApproval / Deny
- **User-configurable trust levels**: Normal / Elevated / FullSystem
- **Preserve full capability** while adding structured control

### Implementation Tasks - ✅ CORE ENGINE COMPLETE

- [x] ✅ **Design SecurityAction model**
  - ✅ Define enum for all sensitive operation types
  - ✅ Include context: target, user, trust level, workspace
  - ✅ Files created: `security/policy/actions.rs` (300+ lines)

- [x] ✅ **Implement PolicyEngine**
  - ✅ Central decision function: action → Allow/RequireApproval/Deny
  - ✅ Risk tier logic based on trust level and context
  - ✅ Files created: `security/policy/engine.rs` (600+ lines), `security/policy/decisions.rs`

- [x] ✅ **Define workspace/project scopes**
  - ✅ User-designated workspace roots stored in settings
  - ✅ Path normalization and scope checking
  - ✅ Files created: `security/policy/scope.rs` (250+ lines)

- [x] ✅ **Create integration helpers**
  - ✅ PolicyState for Tauri commands
  - ✅ Helper functions for common checks
  - ✅ Files created: `security/policy_integration.rs` (300+ lines)

- [ ] ⬜ **Wire policy engine into file operations** (NEXT STEP)
  - Modify: `commands/file_ops.rs` - all file/dir operations
  - Before operation: check policy, enforce decision
  - Status: Integration helpers ready, just need to call them

- [ ] ⬜ **Wire policy engine into shell/terminal** (NEXT STEP)
  - Modify: `commands/git.rs`, `terminal/pty.rs`
  - Validate cwd, check commands against policy

- [ ] ⬜ **Wire policy engine into automation** (NEXT STEP)
  - Modify: `commands/automation.rs`, `commands/capture.rs`
  - Screen capture, input simulation → RequireApproval on first use

- [ ] ⬜ **Wire policy engine into database operations** (NEXT STEP)
  - Modify: `commands/database.rs`
  - External DB connections → RequireApproval

- [ ] ⬜ **Implement approval workflow UI integration** (FRONTEND WORK)
  - Return PolicyError with RequireApproval
  - Frontend shows confirmation modal
  - Retry with approval token

- [x] ✅ **Audit logging framework exists**
  - Existing: `security/audit_logger.rs`
  - Need to integrate with policy decisions

- [ ] ⬜ **Create trust level settings UI** (FRONTEND WORK)
  - Normal (default): restrictive, workspace-scoped
  - Elevated: more Allow, less RequireApproval
  - FullSystem: maximum power, verbose logging

- [ ] ⬜ **Add UX transparency indicators** (FRONTEND WORK)
  - Tray icon notification when screen/input active
  - Visual indicator for elevated trust mode
