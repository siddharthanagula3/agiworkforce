# Eval Command

Evaluate implementation against acceptance criteria: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Run structured evaluation to verify the implementation meets requirements.

## Evaluation Framework

### Grader Types

1. **Binary Grader** - Pass/Fail
   - Does it work? Yes/No
   - Good for: feature completion, bug fixes

2. **Scalar Grader** - Score 0-100
   - How well does it work?
   - Good for: performance, quality metrics

3. **Rubric Grader** - Category scores
   - Multiple dimensions evaluated
   - Good for: comprehensive review

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Define Criteria

```
Acceptance Criteria:
1. [Criterion 1] - [weight]
2. [Criterion 2] - [weight]
3. [Criterion 3] - [weight]
```

### Step 2: Run Tests

For each criterion:
- Execute relevant test
- Collect evidence
- Score result

### Step 3: Report

## Evaluation Report

### Overall: [PASS/FAIL] (Score: X/100)

### Criterion Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
