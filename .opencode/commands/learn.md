# Learn Command

Extract patterns, learnings, and reusable insights from the current session: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Analyze the conversation and code changes to extract:

1. **Patterns discovered** - Recurring solutions or approaches
2. **Best practices applied** - Techniques that worked well
3. **Mistakes to avoid** - Issues encountered and solutions
4. **Reusable snippets** - Code patterns worth saving

## Output Format

### Patterns Discovered

**Pattern: [Name]**
- Context: When to use this pattern
- Implementation: How to apply it
- Example: Code snippet

### Best Practices Applied

1. [Practice name]
   - Why it works
   - When to apply

### Mistakes to Avoid

1. [Mistake description]
   - What went wrong
   - How to prevent it

### Suggested Updates

If patterns are significant, suggest updates to:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project constitution
- `.opencode/instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md` - OpenCode instructions

**TIP**: Run `/learn` periodically during long sessions to capture insights before context compaction.
